### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### About Me
My name is Sayed and I'm a Frontend dev with Fullstack experience with MEAN stack and PHP, and I love to work on hybrid mobile apps. Often, I release code that I use in my own apps/BE which may be helpful to others in form of utilities or helpers. Sometimes, I also create plugins or extensions. Follow me if you think you can help me improve me/my code or if you find my code helpful and want me to take something further!
